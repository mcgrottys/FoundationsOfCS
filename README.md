# FoundationsOfCS

This was a project for Foundations of C.S. I did a while ago. I realized there was no read me so I might as well add something.

This is a demostration of NFA's using javascript and visualized using D3

There are a few examples based off of the problems from Introduction to the Theory of Computation, 3rd edition by Michael Sipser
You can also learn a lot about NFA's  from the first chapter.

You can type in an input for the NFA's and if it's valid the INVALID INPUT text will turn to VALID INPUT.

The drop down on the right has different examples

You can modify the it, select the condition in the first dopdown, click to select a node and click another to link them via that condition, or click new node to have it link to a new node.

You make one is javascript and load it in.

It can be janky at times so  mess with it a bit and it might get fixed. Refreshing the page might help.

You can generate the json structure too. I was to lazy to add a download file button, sorry guys.

ALSO:

The Dark Blue is the starting node, and the Orange are the accepting ones.

It's been a year since I looked at this project so sorry about the bland readme,

Anyway whoever is interested feel free to use this code, and have fun with it.
